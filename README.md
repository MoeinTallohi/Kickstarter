# Kickstarter
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The main concern of this project is to analyze the theatre campaigns based on their date of launch. With creating Kickstarter before conducting the actual analysis, the following shall be done. First the collection of a set data in column years needs to be organized to extract the year from the switch date column. Then with (.  ) of the fields in order to embed filters with mother row and years, rows with date switch get created and columns and figures with results makes a table with data collectively.


### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to attain a view about how different campaigns functions, specific to theatres in regards to their launch date and their financial goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

The main challenge encountered was setting fields. Determining the best data based on choosing best filter, column and row in MS Excel using pivot tables  are essential.  With trial and error methodology this challenge was overcome to envision the data better. Also not having a collection of data was not having a complete set of data to analyze the existing set of data . 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The concern of the analysis is to analyze the theatre campaigns based on the launch date. With creating kickstarter for this, before starting the analysis the following should take place.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This is based on successful, defeated and canceled goals based on the target budget goal. First a new sheet was created with the objective of financial goals that are divided in 12 groups of $1000 to $50000. Then using function the number of successful, defeated and canceled campaign were determined. With calculation of the percentage of Successful, defeated and canceled using linear graph for SUM function was created. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The most amount of success in running the campaign was in May after in June. In May overall 111 campaigns were successfully run while 52 were not and 3 were canceled. Oct Nov and Dec were not successful and their success rate was diminishing. While the campaigns that were not cancelled in Oct had 50 50 chance of success and otherwise.   

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
With the analysis of the data it can be found that the success rate of the campaigns that were launched wth a financial intention less than $5000, is more successful. Campaigns with goal of more than $1000 to $4999 have a success rate in 76% Chanel. And campaigns with financial intention of more than the mentioned figures were about 73%.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The main limitation was lack of data sets from theatre projects specifically scripts.  The main global data sets has 4113 data which only 1065 data is related to the goal.  This issue not only causes problem in categorizing but also makes the assessment of the whole campaign more difficult. To have a better insight from the success of theta projects, collecting Kickstarter data from other platforms is necessary.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A comparison of the campaigns is useful. With following and pursuing the analysis mentioned above, axial graphs to envision the data sets can be well created and organized.
